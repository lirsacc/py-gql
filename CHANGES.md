# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Bugfix: Handle early return from `process_graphql_query` in `py_gql.graphq`.

## 0.2.0

This release follow some extensive internal refactor and legwork in order to make `py_gql` easier to improve and extend moving forward.

### Most notable changes

- **Dropped Python 2 support**; the minimum supported version is now Python 3.5.
- `py_gql.build_schema` is now the preferred way to define executable GraphQL schema (instead of using the `py_gql.schema.Schema` class).
- `py_gql.graphql` now defaults to working with `asyncio`. Use `py_gql.graphql_blocking` for synchronous use cases. This should make things more obvious when implementing subscriptions. `py_gql.process_graphql_query` is still available in order to support custom executors.
- Finalised implementation of schema directives for `py_gql.build_schema`.
- Resolvers can now be assigned with the `py_gql.schema.Schema.resolver` decorator.
- Added type hints for most exposed apis, however some types are still too open and this will be improved moving forward.
- Simplify middleware and tracer implementation: middlewares do not try to be smart and users have to write them against their resolver and executor. Tracers are not based on middlewares anymore.
- Many small performance improvements.
- Returning callables to lazily resolve values has been deprecated.?
- Fixed custom scalars support during execution.
- Updated some error messages to match the reference implementation more closely.
- Implementing custom `py_gql.execution.Executor` is a bit more involved in order to simplify the implementations of the execution layer.
- `py_gql.utilities.diff_schema` added to compare schemas for compatibility.
